# hris-habitat-mapping

This repository contains the code for generating the figures included in a manuscript on habitat mapping using an Enhanced Forest Inventory (EFI).

The dataset underlying these calculations and visualizations is too large for this repository; however, it can be downloaded from Zenodo at the following URL: https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.18020476.
